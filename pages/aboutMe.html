                        I'm actively developing my skills in front-end, especially UI, and

                        Remember why you started.
                        Every line of code, every project coordinated, and every problem 
                        solved brings you closer to creating meaningful impact. Stay 
                        curious, embrace challenges, and never lose sight of the lives 
                        you're touching through your work. The journey is just as 
                        important as the destination.

                    <p>
                        I'm still learning, still growing, still figuring things out, and
                         I think that's exactly where I should be. Every project teaches
                          me something new and every challenge stretches my abilities. I'm not 
                          chasing perfection; I'm pursuing progress, one meaningful 
                          project at a time.
